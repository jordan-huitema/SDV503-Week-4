//-----------------Truthy and Falsy-------------
/*
A falsy value is a value that evaluates to false when converted into a boolean. There are six possible falsy values in JavaScript:
false
undefined
null
0 (numeric zero)
"" (empty string)
NaN (Not A Number)

A truthy value, on the other hand, is a value that evaluates to true when converted into a Boolean. In the case of numbers, anything thatâ€™s not 0 converts to true.
