//If statements allow you to make logic gates
//Else satements can be added to existing if stements to chain them together

//Else if is used so that if the first if statement = true the rest are ignored, if you dont use the else if you could get 2 or more outputs when you only wanted 1 (if the other statemts are also true)

//-----------------Truthy and Falsy-------------
/*
A falsy value is a value that evaluates to false when converted into a boolean. There are six possible falsy values in JavaScript:
false
undefined
null
0 (numeric zero)
"" (empty string)
NaN (Not A Number)

A truthy value, on the other hand, is a value that evaluates to true when converted into a Boolean. In the case of numbers, anything thatâ€™s not 0 converts to true.

  //--------------Switch statments-----------
//A switch statement is a container for case statements 
//Case statements are effetily else if statements but they can be chained if the switch container is not broken (by break;)
//Switch's with containers are a much shorter a and cleaner way of executing if and else if statments and also have extra functinallity

//Putting Default Between Cases
//It dosnt matter where the default output is set it will still output default if other cases are not true or dont end the switch

//If a case dosnt contain a break to stop the switch, the switch will continue and chain the outputs until it reaches the end of the switch array ( }; )  of the switch
let foo = 1;

    console.log("this aint it")
  case 1:
    console.log("just keep truckin");       //because this case dosnt have a break the switch will continue to print preceding case's until it finds one
  case 3:
  case 4:                                   //this case is enabled reguardless of its argument because it procedes a case without a break 
    console.log('I like this number');      //this log will be printed after the prior one (on a new console line) because it is a diffrent output

//much like if statements you can set new vars within the scope of the switch
